1. Time Converter
Logic:

To get the hours, we perform integer division (//) by 60.

To get the remaining minutes, we use the modulo operator (%) with 60, which gives us the remainder.
def convert_minutes(total_minutes):
    # Calculate hours using integer division (floor division)
    hours = total_minutes // 60
    
    # Calculate remaining minutes using the modulo operator
    remaining_minutes = total_minutes % 60
    
    # Handling pluralization for 'hr' vs 'hrs' based on the examples
    hr_label = "hr" if hours == 1 else "hrs"
    
    # Formatting the output
    return f"{hours} {hr_label} {remaining_minutes} minutes"

# --- Test Cases ---
print(f"130 -> {convert_minutes(130)}")
print(f"110 -> {convert_minutes(110)}")

2. Remove Duplicates (Using a Loop)
Logic:

We create an empty string (unique_str) to store the result.

We loop through every character in the original string.

Inside the loop, we check if the character is NOT already in our result string.

If it is not there, we add it. If it is there, we skip it.
def remove_duplicates(input_string):
    unique_str = ""
    
    for char in input_string:
        # Check if the character has already been added
        if char not in unique_str:
            unique_str += char
            
    return unique_str

# --- Test Cases ---
sample_text = "banana"
print(f"Original: {sample_text}")
print(f"Unique:   {remove_duplicates(sample_text)}")

sample_text_2 = "programming"
print(f"Original: {sample_text_2}")
print(f"Unique:   {remove_duplicates(sample_text_2)}")
