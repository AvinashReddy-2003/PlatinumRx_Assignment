1. For every user in the system, get the user_id and last booked room_no
WITH UserBookings AS (
    SELECT 
        user_id, 
        room_no,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY booking_date DESC) as rn
    FROM bookings
)
SELECT user_id, room_no
FROM UserBookings
WHERE rn = 1;

Here are the SQL queries based on the schema provided.

Note on SQL Syntax: I have used standard SQL syntax (compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL). Specifically, I used EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date) for date handling. If you are using SQL Server, you would use MONTH(date), or strftime for SQLite.

1. For every user in the system, get the user_id and last booked room_no
Logic: We need to find the latest booking for each user. We can use a ROW_NUMBER() window function to rank bookings by date for each user, then select only the top one.

SQL

WITH UserBookings AS (
    SELECT 
        user_id, 
        room_no,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY booking_date DESC) as rn
    FROM bookings
)
SELECT user_id, room_no
FROM UserBookings
WHERE rn = 1;

2. Get booking_id and total billing amount of every booking created in November, 2021
SELECT 
    b.booking_id,
    SUM(bc.item_quantity * i.item_rate) AS total_billing_amount
FROM bookings b
JOIN booking_commercials bc ON b.booking_id = bc.booking_id
JOIN items i ON bc.item_id = i.item_id
WHERE b.booking_date >= '2021-11-01' AND b.booking_date < '2021-12-01'
GROUP BY b.booking_id;

3. Get bill_id and bill amount of all the bills raised in October, 2021 having bill amount > 1000
SELECT 
    bc.bill_id,
    SUM(bc.item_quantity * i.item_rate) AS bill_amount
FROM booking_commercials bc
JOIN items i ON bc.item_id = i.item_id
WHERE bc.bill_date >= '2021-10-01' AND bc.bill_date < '2021-11-01'
GROUP BY bc.bill_id
HAVING SUM(bc.item_quantity * i.item_rate) > 1000;

4. Determine the most ordered and least ordered item of each month of year 2021
WITH MonthlyStats AS (
    SELECT 
        EXTRACT(MONTH FROM bill_date) AS month_num,
        item_id,
        SUM(item_quantity) AS total_qty
    FROM booking_commercials
    WHERE bill_date BETWEEN '2021-01-01' AND '2021-12-31'
    GROUP BY EXTRACT(MONTH FROM bill_date), item_id
),
RankedItems AS (
    SELECT 
        month_num,
        item_id,
        total_qty,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY month_num ORDER BY total_qty DESC) as rank_most,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY month_num ORDER BY total_qty ASC) as rank_least
    FROM MonthlyStats
)
SELECT 
    month_num,
    MAX(CASE WHEN rank_most = 1 THEN item_id END) AS most_ordered_item,
    MAX(CASE WHEN rank_least = 1 THEN item_id END) AS least_ordered_item
FROM RankedItems
GROUP BY month_num;

5. Find the customers with the second highest bill value of each month of year 2021
WITH BillTotals AS (
    SELECT 
        u.user_id,
        u.name,
        bc.bill_id,
        EXTRACT(MONTH FROM bc.bill_date) as month_num,
        SUM(bc.item_quantity * i.item_rate) as total_bill_value
    FROM booking_commercials bc
    JOIN items i ON bc.item_id = i.item_id
    JOIN bookings b ON bc.booking_id = b.booking_id
    JOIN users u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
    WHERE bc.bill_date BETWEEN '2021-01-01' AND '2021-12-31'
    GROUP BY u.user_id, u.name, bc.bill_id, EXTRACT(MONTH FROM bc.bill_date)
),
RankedBills AS (
    SELECT 
        month_num,
        name,
        total_bill_value,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY month_num ORDER BY total_bill_value DESC) as rn
    FROM BillTotals
)
SELECT month_num, name, total_bill_value
FROM RankedBills
WHERE rn = 2;
